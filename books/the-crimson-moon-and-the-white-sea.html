                <h1>The Crimson Moon and the White Sea: A Forbidden Romantic Chinese Fantasy</h1>
                <p>A heartbreaking Romantasy coming 2025, perfect for fans of Sue Lynn Tan, Amelie Wen Zhao, and c-drama in general!</p>
                <p><strong>Their love was cursed, their fall inevitable. An isolated goddess. A wounded demon.</strong></p>
                <p>The gods and goddesses of the Ethereal Court ruled this realm, and they made it their mission to eradicate all demons. For they are bloodthirsty monsters that need to be stopped, and anyone who aided them will face the wrath of the gods, even <em>other gods.</em></p>
                <p>Qi, a powerful goddess, always kept to herself on the idyllic Crescent Island, sequestered from the rest of the world, healing lost souls that came her way. Yet the night she saved Xun, a demon, changed everything she thought she knew about them and made herself an accomplice.</p>
                <p>For she had broken both laws of the Realm: obey the Ethereal Court and kill any demon on sight. If discovered, their punishment is nothing short of a slow and painful death and the massacre of the Island she vows to protect.</p>
                <p>Yet despite her better judgment, Qi finds herself drawn to a creature so elegant and different from her kind, and sending him away after he is cured no longer seems like the option her heart wants.</p>
                <p><em>Their love will be their demise.</em></p>
                <p><em>Just as happiness seemed within their grasps, a cruel fate awaited. When two worlds collide like fire and water, all thatâ€™s left is ruination.</em></p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><strong>The Crimson Moon and the White Sea</strong> is a prequel novella in the Blood Demon series set in a reimagined Xian Xia world with Chinese mythology, spellbinding love and hollowing betrayal, and mutual salvation. Current release date is a placeholder, will be moved to an earlier date.</p>
